With the help of clustering techniques, **B2C** (Business to customers) companies can identify the several segments of customers that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits.This will allow them to target the potential user base. \n\n\\- In this Data Science Project, we will perform one of the most essential applications of machine learning – Customer Segmentation.

K-means clustering**\nAfter exploring each feature of our dataset, now it's time to segment the customers based on their features. In order to do that, we will use k-means clustering. This algorithm starts by selecting k objects from dataset randomly that will serve as the initial centers for our clusters  known as centroids. Then at each step, the algorithm seek to minimize the intra distance which is the distance between individuals within each cluste and maximize the inter-distance which is the distance between clusters.\n\n* **Determining Optimal number of Clusters:**\n\nWhile working with clusters, we need to specify the number of clusters to use. Thus we need to find the optimal number of clusters, to do that we will use the Silhouette method.\n * **Average Silhouette Method:**\n\n With the help of the average silhouette method, we can measure the quality of our clustering operation. With this, we can determine how well within the cluster is the data object. If we obtain a high average silhouette width, it means that we have good clustering. The average silhouette method calculates the mean of silhouette observations for different k values. With the optimal number of k clusters, one can maximize the average silhouette over significant values for k clusters.\n \n"},{"metadata":{"id":"AzEhkTU3eHEP","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"customers_df['Gender'] = customers_df.Gender.map({'Male':1,'Female':0})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"LMoH04tpGuzk","outputId":"a3e23afe-484d-4bb9-ce0d-7b8938018cf7","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_samples, silhouette_score\nimport matplotlib.cm as cm\n\nl=[]\nX = customers_df.iloc[:,1:]\nfor n_clusters in range(2,11):\n    fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(1, 1)\n    fig.set_size_inches(15, 7)\n\n\n    ax1.set_xlim([-.1, 1])\n    # The (n_clusters+1)*10 is for inserting blank space between silhouette\n    # plots of individual clusters, to demarcate them clearly.\n    ax1.set_ylim([0, len(X) + (n_clusters + 1) * 10])\n\n    # Initialize the clusterer with n_clusters value and a random generator\n    # seed of 10 for reproducibility.\n    clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=10)\n    cluster_labels = clusterer.fit_predict(X)\n\n    # The silhouette_score gives the average value for all the samples.\n    # This gives a perspective into the density and separation of the formed\n    # clusters\n    silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(X, cluster_labels)\n    print(\"For n_clusters =\", n_clusters,\n          \"The average silhouette_score is :\", silhouette_avg)\n    l.append(silhouette_avg)\n    # Compute the silhouette scores for each sample\n    sample_silhouette_values = silhouette_samples(X, cluster_labels)\n\n    y_lower = 10\n    for i in range(n_clusters):\n        # Aggregate the silhouette scores for samples belonging to\n        # cluster i, and sort them\n        ith_cluster_silhouette_values = \\\n            sample_silhouette_values[cluster_labels == i]\n\n        ith_cluster_silhouette_values.sort()\n\n        size_cluster_i = ith_cluster_silhouette_values.shape[0]\n        y_upper = y_lower + size_cluster_i\n\n        color = cm.nipy_spectral(float(i) / n_clusters)\n        ax1.fill_betweenx(np.arange(y_lower, y_upper),\n                          0, ith_cluster_silhouette_values,\n                          facecolor=color, edgecolor=color, alpha=0.7)\n\n        # Label the silhouette plots with their cluster numbers at the middle\n        ax1.text(-0.05, y_lower + 0.5 * size_cluster_i, str(i))\n\n        # Compute the new y_lower for next plot\n        y_lower = y_upper + 10  # 10 for the 0 samples\n\n    ax1.set_title(\"The silhouette plot for the various clusters.\")\n    ax1.set_xlabel(\"The silhouette coefficient values\")\n    ax1.set_ylabel(\"Cluster label\")\n\n    # The vertical line for average silhouette score of all the values\n    ax1.axvline(x=silhouette_avg, color=\"red\", linestyle=\"--\")\n\n    ax1.set_yticks([])  # Clear the yaxis labels / ticks\n    ax1.set_xticks([-0.1, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1])\n\n    \n\n    plt.suptitle((\"Silhouette analysis for KMeans clustering on Customers data \"\n                  \"with n_clusters = %d\" % n_clusters),\n                 fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')\n    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"AjkRyD2Jflk3","outputId":"0371a876-ab65-4ee2-d3d9-6997fc50ddf7","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clusters = list(range(2,11))\nplt.plot(clusters,l,'-bo')\naxes = plt.axes()\naxes.set_xlabel(\"Number of clusters k\")\naxes.set_ylabel(\"Average silhouette Width\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"L1ZlZDo2hlG5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\\- As we can see from the figure above, the optimal number of clusters k for our customers segmentation task is 6 with an average silhouette width of 0.45."},{"metadata":{"id":"ZnYN3zGAjW5F"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### **3.
